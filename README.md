# CarND-PID-Controller

PID advantages:
* Low computational cost which is interessting particularly for a limited computation embedded environment like on a self-driving car
* Easy to program

PID disadvantages:
* Less intuitive concept than other controllers
* Hyper parameter tuning by hand or by decent gradient if possible
